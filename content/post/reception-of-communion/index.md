Catholic couples should not only marry with a Mass, but are strongly encouraged to receive the Eucharist at their first Mass as a married couple. 

The married couple enjoys two privileges that have been lost in the last century or so of reforms: they may receive first (after the priest), and they may receive both species of Communion.
