On August 6, 1966, the daughter of the sitting U.S. President married in a Catholic wedding Mass in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.

Luci Baines Johnson, baptized an Episcopalian, had converted to Catholicism upon her engagement to the Catholic Pat Nugent. 

This wedding is remarkable for a number of reasons. 

Firstly, the weddings we tend to know about are royal weddings, and this is the American equivalent. Secondly, America has has a turbulent relationship with Catholicism. In the wake of JFK's assassination and his widely televised funeral Mass, a stately Catholic wedding Mass garnered high interest. Thirdly, while liturgical reforms were ongoing for many preceding decades, 1966 is a particularly interesting year. The details of the Mass will interest scholars and students of this topic. And lastly, sadly, is the fact that John and Nugent's marriage (4 children later) was annulled 13 years later.

Nation Attends Wedding

The United States went to a wedding last Saturday.

The bride was Luci Baines Johnson, 19, of this city; the bridegroom was Patrick John Nugent, 23, of Wauken, Ill. 

Hosts to some 700 of those attending in person were President and Mrs. Lyndon Baines Johnson, parents of the bride. 

Hosts to other millions were the three nationwide television networks. 

For the first wedding of a member of an incumbent first family to take place in a Catholic church, the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception was set with a backgroun of white flowers and great masses of greenery contrasting with the Shrine's massive and brilliant mosaic of Christ in Majesty. 

Kneeling on a double kneeler in the sanctuary of the church, and flanked by maid of honor Lynda Bird Johnson and Gerard Nugent, Sr., proxy best-man and father of the bridegroom, Luci and Pat consented to marriage according to the ancient rite of the Church. Witnessing the marriage was Father John A. Kuzinskas of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church, Chicago, a longtime friend of the bridegroom. 

The marriage ceremony followed the Gospel of a concelebrated nuptial Mass. Chief concelebrant was Archbishop Patrick A. O'Boyle of Washington. Other concelebrants were Father Kuzinskas and Father William J. Kaifer, S.J., of Georgetown University School of Nursing, advisor to the bride during her student days there. 

Seated in the sanctuary were Archbishop John P. Cody of Chicago, the bridegroom's archdiocese, and Msgr. Thomas J. Grady, director of the National Shrine. 

The 700 guests at the wedding followed the ceremony from leaflet missals arranged especially for the occasion. Bound in gold and white with the front cover bearing a picture of the Shrine, "The Mass On the Day of Marriage," was in the usual arrangement for such booklets but omitted directional notes. Also omitted were the prayers at the foot of the altar which the choir sang. 

Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La., a Catholic layman and friend of the Johnson family, read the epistle, containing St. Paul's famous advice for a happy marriage: 

"Wives be submissive to their husbands as though to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife...

"Husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies..." 

Father Kaifer read St. Matthew's Gospel. 

Luci and Pat received Communion in the form of both bread and wine. 

Following the ceremony, Luci placed her bridal bouquet before a color reproduction of the shrine's St. Agatha altar. The reproduction was placed at the altar of Our Lady to the left of the main altar, since a trip to the crypt altar where the St. Agatha Shrine is was impractical. St. Agatha [is the pa] -tron saint of nursing, th[e pro]fession Luci studied las[t year] at Georgetown University. 

The "something bor[rowed"] carried by Luci Baines J[ohnson] at her wedding was a m[other-]of-pearl and gold rosary [???] -ing to her sister, Lynda. The rosary was present[ed to] the older Johnson girl [by the] late Pope John XXIII du[ring a] 1962 audience. 

For "something old" [she] chose a 58-uear old ivor[y] handkerchief made by [her] great-grandmother, Mrs. [???] Ament Huffman Baines, [???] daughter, Mrs. Josefa Saunders, to carry at he[r wed]ding in 1908. 

A gold locket tied with [???] ribbon and belonging to Gerard P. Nugent, mot[her of] the bridegroom, was carr[ied by] Luci for a touch of "som[ething] blue." 

The "sixpence in her [???"] was the first of Adele Ros[???] Perth Amboy, N.J., the f[???] many people around the [coun]try who thought to sen[???] along. 

The "something new" [???] really new. Her trad[???[ wedding gown by Prisci[???] Boston provided about th[???] detail of the ceremony su[???]fully kept from the public [???] big day.
