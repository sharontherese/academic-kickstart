On August 6, 1966, the daughter of the sitting U.S. President married in a Catholic wedding Mass in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.

Luci Baines Johnson, baptized an Episcopalian, had converted to Catholicism upon her engagement to the Catholic Pat Nugent. 

This wedding is remarkable for a number of reasons. 

Firstly, the weddings we tend to know about are royal weddings, and this is the American equivalent. Secondly, America has has a turbulent relationship with Catholicism. In the wake of JFK's assassination and his widely televised funeral Mass, a stately Catholic wedding Mass garnered high interest. Thirdly, while liturgical reforms were ongoing for many preceding decades, 1966 is a particularly interesting year. The details of the Mass will interest scholars and students of this topic. And lastly, sadly, is the fact that John and Nugent's marriage (4 children later) was annulled 13 years later.
