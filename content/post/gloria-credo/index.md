One of the most common questions regarding Latin Mass weddings is, "Do you include the Gloria and/or the Creed?" 

(Note: This post is not intended to tell you what to do for your wedding Mass. I am neither priest nor (thank goodness) liturgist. While I think there is an answer to this question, those planning a TLM wedding should bring this up with their priest. This post instead is a collection of sources that answer but more importantly illustrate why there is confusion on this point.) 

My findings were, inadvertently, a microcosm of mid/late 20th century liturgical reforms. 

Before 1960, the rubrics as per the Roman Missal and every commentary I have found was to omit the Gloria and the Credo from the _Missa pro sponso_. This was in keeping with the nature of both parts of the Mass, which were historically reserved for important feasts. The rubrical revisions in 1960 and the subsequent 1962 Roman Missal allowed for the Gloria to be said for the _Missa pro sponso_. 

What complicates this ostensibly simple history is that commentaries and hand missals did not always note this 1960/1962 change, and continually published material that said the Missa pro sponso omits the Gloria. In fact, the _only_ contemporary (1960s) source that I have found that has the updated (includes Gloria) rubrics is from Father Frederick mcManus, one of the most "plugged in" priests regarding liturgical reforms and discussions. 

Further complicating this is a number of Catholic newspaper articles reporting on wedding Masses that include the Gloria. 

Below is a sample of sources, arranged chronologically. They can be considered in three tiers: of primary importance (the Roman Missal and its supplements), of secondary importance (rubrical commentaries), and of tertiary importance (hand missals). I include less weighty sources like hand missals as they are what the average Catholic may have referenced to answer this question, and are therefore important at least regarding the contradictory answers.

> With regard to the insertion of the Gloria into the Roman Mass liturgy, we have only obscure and uncertain accounts. The use of the Gloria was originally and for a long period rather restricted: it served by preference for the expression of Christmas joy and the Easter chant of exultation. Until nearly the close of the eleventh century the rubrics of the Gregorian Sacramentary prevailed, which granted or prescribed the recitation of the Gloria by the bishop on all Sundays and feast-days; by the priest, on the contrary, only at Easter. But from that time this privilege of the bishops was extended also to priests. Since the revision of the Missal under Pope Pius V. (t 1572) the following rule holds good: as often as the Te Deum occurs in the Matins of the Office, the Gloria is said in the Mass corresponding to the Office; but if the Ambrosian Hymn is omitted in the Office, then in the Mass of the day the Angels Hymn is not to be recited.

> [The Creed] occurs in the latter liturgy only on certain days as a mark of special distinction.

(In the pages that follow, Gihr does not include the _Missa pro sponso_ as one of the masses that merits the Credo.)

> If NUPTIAL MASS is to follow, the priest vests and Mass begins. The nuptial Mass is the votive Mass “Pro sponso et sponsa,” in the missal. It is said with white vestments, without _Gloria in excelsis_ or creed.

> Si solemnis benedictio Nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit die Dominica, vel alio die Festo, sive de praecepto, licet suppresso, sive Duplici I vel II classis, aut in Octavis Epiphaniae, Paschatis, Pentecostes aut Corporis Christi, vel in Feriis ac vigiliis privilegiatis, dicatur Missa de officio occurrenti, cum Gloria in excelsis et Credo, si illa Missa id requirat, et cum Commemoratione sequentis Missae pro Sponso et Sponsa, et reliquis quae pro Communione et complemento benedictionis in ea habentur. Si autem solemnis benedictio Nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit aliis diebus, etiamsi in iis occurrat Festum Duplex majus vel minus, dicatur sequens Missa votiva pro Sponso et Sponsa, praeterquam in Commemoratione Omnium Fidelium Defunctorum, in qua et Missa votica et solemnis benedictio Nuptialis prohibentur. 

(The Roman Missal itself may be a source of confusion, especially for beginners like myself. The rubrics do say "cum Gloria...et Credo," but they are not actually referring to the nuptial Mass. They refer to occasions in which the nuptial Mass is superceded by a greater feast.
