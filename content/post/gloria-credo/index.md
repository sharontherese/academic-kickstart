One of the most common questions that comes up within the realm of Latin Mass weddings is, "Do you include the Gloria and/or the Creed?" 

The question continues because the sources seem to disagree. 

This post is not intended to tell you what to do for your wedding Mass. I am neither priest nor (thank goodness) liturgist. This is simply a collation of rubrics, and rubric commentaries, on the Gloria and the Credo for the wedding Mass, and why there is some confusion on the point. My findings were, inadvertently, a microcosm of mid/late 20th century liturgical reforms. 

Before 1960, the rubrics as per the Roman Missal and every rubrical commentary I have found was to omit the Gloria and the Credo from the _Missa pro sponso_. This was in keeping with the nature of both parts of the Mass, which were historically reserved for important feasts. The rubrical revisions in 1960 and the subsequent 1962 Roman Missal allowed for the Gloria to be said for the _Missa pro sponso_. 

What complicates this ostensibly simple history is that rubrical commentaries and hand missals did not always note this 1960/1962 change, and continually published missals and materials that said the Missa pro sponso omits the Gloria. In fact, the _only_ contemporary (1960s) source that I have found that has the updated (includes Gloria) rubrics is from Father Frederick mcManus, one of the most "plugged in" priests regarding liturgical reforms and discussions. 

Below is a sample of sources, arranged chronologically. They can be considered in three tiers: of primary importance (the Roman Missal and its supplements), of secondary importance (rubrical commentaries), and of tertiary importance (hand missals). I include less weighty sources like hand missals as they are what the average Catholic may have referenced to answer this question, and are therefore important at least regarding the contradictory answers.

> With regard to the insertion of the Gloria into the Roman Mass liturgy, we have only obscure and uncertain accounts. The use of the Gloria was originally and for a long period rather restricted: it served by preference for the expression of Christmas joy and the Easter chant of exultation. Until nearly the close of the eleventh century the rubrics of the Gregorian Sacramentary prevailed, which granted or prescribed the recitation of the Gloria by the bishop on all Sundays and feast-days; by the priest, on the contrary, only at Easter. But from that time this privilege of the bishops was extended also to priests. Since the revision of the Missal under Pope Pius V. (t 1572) the following rule holds good: as often as the Te Deum occurs in the Matins of the Office, the Gloria is said in the Mass corresponding to the Office; but if the Ambrosian Hymn is omitted in the Office, then in the Mass of the day the Angels Hymn is not to be recited.

> [The Creed] occurs in the latter liturgy only on certain days as a mark of special distinction.

(In the pages that follow, Gihr does not include the _Missa pro sponso_ as one of the masses that merits the Credo.)
