For couples who will have a Novus Ordo wedding but Want to make the ceremonies as traditional as possible, here are several suggestions. 

Note: All of these require approval from the priest celebrating the Mass, and possibly the church's wedding coordinator. Please be courteous to your priests. 

# Mass Readings 

You may be given a list or a booklet of reading options for the wedding Mass. The following readings options are the same as the votive Mass Missa pro sponso et sponsa: 

# Preface 

The Preface is a prayer said by the priest before the Sanctus. One of the Preface options is the Nuptial Preface (Praefatio de Nuptiis). This Preface option was made available to Latin Mass weddings in 2019, so it provides a bridge between the two forms of the Mass. The Preface is also ancient. 

# Nuptial Blessing 
There are a number of options for the nuptial blessing in the current rite. Request the traditional nuptial blessing. 
# Music 
Music is a tricky category. The rubrics for the Novus Ordo are extremely flexible regarding music, but some musicians have found that for a Novus Ordo Mass, wholesale replacing hymns with Latin chanted propers may be aesthetically jarring. 
That said, there are plenty of ways to make your Mass music more traditional. 
Organ is the ideal instrument for the Mass. 
Choose classic, simple hymns, such as Adoro Te Devote. 
If you do choose chant, unaccompanied voices are the most dignified. 
If there is a Mass text from the Missa pro sponso that you were not able to use, see if you can incorporate a sung version (chant, polyphony, or other) of the Mass text elsewhere. The best places for extra music are during the Offertory, and as a prelude. 
# Outside the Mass 
All of the above categories have to do with the wedding Mass itself. There are some extra-liturgical things you can do too! 
## Fashion 
Follow the parish’s guidelines on attire for the day regarding modesty. In addition, consider checking traditional etiquette that factors in your wedding date and time of day. Tuxedos, for example, technically should only be worn for evening events. Winter events recommend jewel tones. 
## Flowers 
There are some (perhaps no longer applicable) flower rubrics – i.e., where one can place flowers in the church, and whether the flowers should be cut or alive. Always consult with your priest or wedding coordinator before worrying about this.
Flowers have rich histories, and many flowers have connections to Mary and the saints. Based on your wedding colors, tastes, and budget, consider looking into flowers that may have a special connection to a saint you are devoted to.
## Customs 
The Church has always been extremely accommodating of local customs in weddings, as long as they do not interfere with the liturgical ceremonies. If you don’t know of any wedding customs, consider asking your family or researching your place of origin. 
Some popular traditional customs include: 
Leaving flowers to Mary after Communion 
Lasso 
Arras
Velatio Nuptialis (this is cheating; it is not popular. But it should be.) 
Crowning (not common in the Roman Rite, but common in many Eastern Rites)
