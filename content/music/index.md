# About

The ideal music _setting_ for the Mass is _gregorian chant_, followed by _polyphony_. In a sung _Latin Mass_, or _high Mass_, what is sung are the _propers_ and _ordinaries_. Historically, hymns were discouraged in the Mass. Your Latin Mass wedding music will depend mostly on the musical resources available to your church.

Sancta Missa provides a 4-page Q&A booklet on Nuptial Mass music: 

Haynes, S.J.C., Reverend Scott A. “**Guidelines for Liturgical Services According to the 1962 Missale Romanum: Music for Nuptial High Mass**.” Biretta Books, 2007. https://sanctamissa.org/en/music/musical-guidelines-for-the-traditional-roman-rite/liturgical-services-music-for-the-nuptial-high-mass.pdf.

Here is how our wedding Mass music looked:

> **Prelude:**  
> _Veni Creator Spiritus_, Rabanus Maurus (gregorian chant)  
> _Alma Redemptoris_, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (polyphony)
>
> **Procession:**  
> _Te Deum_, Marc-Antoine Charpentier (organ)
>
> **Propers:**  
> all gregorian chant
>
> **Ordinaries:**  
> Mass setting VIII, Missa de Angelis (gregorian chant)
>
> **Offertory motet:**  
> Psalm 117 (gregorian chant)
>
> **Communion motet:**  
> _Sicut Cervus_, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (polyphony)  
> _Te Deum_, Nicetas of Remesiana (gregorian chant)
>
> **Presentation of flowers to Mary:**  
> _Ave Verum Corpus_, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (polyphony)
>
> **Recessional:**  
> _O God Beyond All Praising_, Michael Perry (hymn)  
> _Organ Symphony No. 5, Toccata_, Charles-Marie Widor (organ)

## Polyphonic settings 

Polyphonic settings of the nuptial propers are one of the most difficult types of wedding music to find. The only concrete information on such settings I have found is in the Musica Sacra forums. 

“**Needed: SATB Polyphony for Wedding, One Voice per Part**.” MusicaSacra Church Music Forum (blog). Accessed August 6, 2019. https://forum.musicasacra.com/forum/discussion/comment/44797#Comment_44797.

# Ordinaries

![](/uploads/kyrie.png)

The _ordinaries_ are the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the Credo is not included in the wedding Mass). There is an optional Preface for the wedding Mass as well.

## Gregorian chant settings

“**St. Antoine Daniel Kyriale**.” Corpus Christi Watershed. Accessed July 29, 2019. [http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/ "http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/"). 

## Polyphonic settings

Unlike the paucity of polyphonic propers, there is an abundance of options for settings for the ordinaries. Below are some of the more famous settings, renowned for beauty and/or simplicity. 

Rusca, Francesco Spagnoli. “Missa Brevis.” IMSLP Petrucci Music Library. Accessed August 6, 2019. https://imslp.org/wiki/Missa_Brevis_(Rusca%2C_Francesco_Spagnoli). 11 pages. G major. Baroque.

## Praefatio de Nuptiis 

The Praefatio de Nuptiis is a new preface option (but a very old preface) for the wedding Mass. I wrote about it [here](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/post/preface/). 

The excellent site Gregobase has provided square notation sheet music for the chanted version of this preface: https://gregobase.selapa.net/chant.php?id=10469

# Other Sacred Music

_Alma chorus domini in the The Winchester Troper, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 473: 129r_

Below are a few popular choices for hymns, motets, and chants for the wedding Mass. Many of these texts have more than one setting. If you need inspiration, consider the background of you and your future spouse (French, Italian, Irish, etc.), or the feasts on/near your wedding day. If your wedding day is near, for example, St. Thomas Aquinas' feast day, you could choose one of the many songs he composed, or a song centered on the Eucharist, a common theme in St. Thomas' works.

## Sequences 

A sequence is a hymn sung before the Gospel. Before the Council of Trent, there were hundreds of sequences for various Masses and feasts. The Tridentine reforms winnowed the sequences in the Roman Missal to 4 (now 5), the most famous of which is likely the _Dies Irae._ The [Sarum Use](/other-rites-and-languages/) of the Roman Rite used the sequence _Alma Chorus Domini_ for its nuptial Masses (which was typically the Mass of the Trinity). Below are links to a PDF of the Latin and the English sheet music.

## Marian chants

* Alma Redemptoris Mater (Marian atiphon for: Advent through February 1) 
* Ave, Regina Caelorum (Marian atiphon for: February 2 through Good Friday)
* Regina Caeli (Marian atiphon for: during the season of Easter)
* Salve Regina (Marian atiphon for: after Pentecost)
* Ave maris stella

## Composers 

The following composers have written many sacred music pieces: Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Franz Schubert, Tomas Luis de Victoria, Orlando de Lassus, Josquin, Tommaso de Celano, Thomas Tallis, Hildegard of Bingen, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, Anton Bruckner, Edward Elgar, Charles Gounod, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi

Below are a few favorites from that list: 

* Ave verum Corpus, Mozart
* Ave verum, William Byrd
* Ave maria, Schubert
* Sicut cervus, Palestrina 
* If ye love me, Thomas Tallis
